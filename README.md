# Shopping Cart V1 - f9b5658c-a34c-d06e-ce2c-4553f3aeec20

We want to build a Product Listing page and a Shopping Cart page using Vue.js.

## The Challenge

Create a basic shopping cart application. We want to:

* Display a list of products from the provided products.js
* Add items to the cart
* Remove items from the cart
* Display the number of items in the cart
* Display the total price of the items in the cart
* Display the total price for each group of items in the cart based on quantity
* Change our “Add To Cart” button caption to “Sold Out” and disable it when inventory is depleted.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repo for the Apllication and a documentation for explaining how it works.

## Requirements:

We prefer Vuejs in our application so this is the only mandatory option.

Feel free to add any library that you feel comfortable with.

## Helpful information

* Use GitHub and try to keep a decent history of how you approached the project.
* At the deadline if you weren't able to finish the task. Please send the parts you already did.

* This is just a challenge. In no way whatsoever we will use your code for commercial purposes.
* Please don't distribute this assignment to 3rd parties.
